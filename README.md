🐍 Python

👁️ OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)

📹 Camera feed or pre-recorded video/images

📝 Jupyter Notebook or Python script

✨ Features
✅ Detects vehicles in parking spaces using contour detection and image processing techniques.
✅ Counts occupied and free parking spots in real-time.
✅ Annotates parking spots with visual overlays for easy monitoring.
✅ Configurable region of interest for different parking layouts.

🚀 Getting Started
📌 Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed

OpenCV library (pip install opencv-python)

Numpy (pip install numpy)
